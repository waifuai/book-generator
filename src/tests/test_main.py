# Note: Keep necessary imports if there were module-level fixtures or helpers,
# but in this case, the classes contained all tests.
# Imports like patch, MagicMock, Path, json etc. are now in the specific test files.

# All test classes (TestAPIConfig, TestContentGenerator, TestTableOfContents,
# TestBookWriter, TestBookGenerator) have been moved to their respective files:
# - test_content_generation.py
# - test_table_of_contents.py
# - test_book_writer.py
# - test_book_generator.py

# TestAPIConfig was removed entirely as APIConfig is no longer used.

# This file can remain minimal or be used for integration tests later if needed.
